"""
This example demonstrates how a poisoned injection can be persistent between sessions by using the
agent's memory. This is a feature that not many companies have integrated yet.
This could also work if the AI can set user account data, it just needs a single writable property
that is rescanned in the context window on launch (such as the username)
